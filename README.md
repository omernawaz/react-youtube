# TASK: Use Google Youtube Search API and make a React App just like Youtube.

It will have a search input and based on the search query, show results. 
There would be a single selected Item with the Video Player on the left side, just like youtube. 
Make proper use of CSS to style the app. 
Feel free to use the boilerplate code if needed.
